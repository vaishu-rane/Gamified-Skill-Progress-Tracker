# Gamified-Skill-Progress-Tracker
Gamified Skill Progress Tracker project

# Goal of this project
The goal of this project is to help users track their learning progress and stay motivated through a gamified skill-tracking platform.
-Users can sign up/login securely.
-Admins can create skills and milestones (like “Java Basics → OOP → Spring Boot”).
-Users can start and complete milestones, earning XP and leveling up.
-The system automatically awards badges when milestones are achieved.
-A leaderboard motivates users by ranking them based on XP and levels.
-The app encourages continuous learning and engagement, like a mix of a progress tracker + gamification.
